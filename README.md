# VKBot_NoobLife (Created March 28, 2022)

Actually, this is my first experience in sqlite3 and vkbottle library. So it has a lot of crutches and bad practices.
I don't think that this code will be useful to anyone because it's developed for a specific case.
It has also been censored a bit in the replies. If you want an uncensored version, please contact me at the links in my GitHub account.
